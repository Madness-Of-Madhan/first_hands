    <p>Trading as a business allows you to clearly identify all your expenses and losses. This helps you reduce uncertainty, risk, stress, and even taxes. Too often traders imagine that they're in the business of prediction. This point of view often generates unproductive effort. Traders who realize they're in the business of risk management begin to focus their efforts more productively.

    </p>

    <p>Trading is a competitive business so it's safe to assume that the person on the other side of a trade is taking full advantage of all available technology.

        Charting platforms give traders infinite ways to view and analyze markets. Backtesting an idea using historical data prevents costly missteps. Getting market updates via your smartphone allows you to monitor trades anywhere. A high-speed internet connection can increase trading performance. Using technology to your advantage and keeping current with new products can be fun and rewarding.
